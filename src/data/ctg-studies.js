Variables to be analyzed include demographics, liver disease status, metabolic comorbidities, lifestyle factors, medications, as well as laboratory parameters and non-invasive scoring systems.","detailedDescription":"Introduction:\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly fatal cancer with a global 5-year survival rate of less than 20%. In Egypt, HCC is the most common cancer in men and the leading cause of cancer-related death, primarily due to the historically high prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). While sustained virologic response (SVR) after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy significantly reduces the risk of HCC, it can still occur, especially in patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. This necessitates continued HCC surveillance post-HCV cure.\n\nAim of Work:\n\nTo study various clinical and laboratory predictors of hepatocellular carcinoma in Egyptian cirrhotic patients after achieving sustained virologic response.\n\nMethodology:\n\nStudy Design: Retrospective, two-center case-control study.\n\nSetting \\& Period: Two tertiary hepatology centers: Sohag University Hospital and Sohag Oncology Center.\n\nSVR was achieved between January 1, 2016 - December 31, 2019\n\nParticipants:\n\nCases: SVR patients who developed HCC\n\nInclusion Criteria: (1) age ≥ 18 y; (2) HCV related cirrhosis; (3) SVR12 after DAA; (4) radiologic or histologic HCC diagnosis ≤30 Jun 2025\n\nExclusion Criteria: (1) non HCV cirrhosis or combined HCV-HBV cirrhosis; (2) HCC \\<6 months before SVR; (3) concomitant cholangiocarcinoma\n\nControls: SVR patients who did not develop HCC Inclusion Criteria: As above plus,\n\n≥36 months post SVR without HCC\n\nExclusion Criteria: Same as cases, plus loss to follow-up before 36 months\n\nSample Size: Using Fleiss' formula yields 120 cases \\& 240 controls (360 total).

Approximately 150 million worldwide are suffering from this condition and the number is expected to rise to 300 million by 2025. In Singapore, diabetes is the 10th leading cause of death accounting for 1.7 per cent total deaths in 2011. By 2030, the number of Singapore residents above 40 with diabetes is projected to increase by another 200,000 from about 400,000 today (Diabetes in Singapore: Stats and Prevention Tips - HealthXchange, n.d.). Despite having one of the world's highest life expectancies and a modern health care system, Singapore has one of the highest rates of lower extremity amputation (LEA) in the world, with public hospitals here needing to conduct some four amputation procedures a day ((Amputation of Limbs Regarded as a Last Resort - Singapore General Hospital, n.d.)).\n\nHowever, patients who seek treatment early enough have the option of various intervention treatments to salvage limbs. These include re-vascularisation (angioplasty or bypass) and treatment of infection (drainage of abscesses or debridement). In Singapore, limb salvage therapies have led to a 20% reduction in LEA operations in 2015 compared to the year before ((SINGAPORE: ONE OF WORLD'S HIGHEST FOR DIABETES-RELATED LEG AMPUTATIONS, n.d.)). Unfortunately, the clinical success of these procedures in diabetics drop to 69% at 12 months (Lazaris et al., 2004). This is owing to the lack of objective feedback of limb perfusion. Non invasive imaging modalities that predict outcomes of such revascularization procedures can help in early intervention and thus limb salvage. Recently, SFDI, a noninvasive optical imaging method capable of measuring tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) and tissue haemoglobin has been show to predict diabetic foot ulcer onset in the US population (Lee et al., 2020). Herein, we hypothesize that these microvasculature information offered by SFDI can be used to predict the outcomes of revascularization procedures. To test this hypothesis, we propose an exploratory pilot study to use SFDI on 15 diabetic patients undergoing lower limb revascularization and acquire images of the plantar foot before and after the intervention."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Peripheral Arterial Disease(PAD)","Imaging Evaluation"],"keywords":["Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging","Peripheral Arterial Disease","Non-invasive imaging"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","interventionModelDescription":"Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging (SFDI) Imaging pre and post-ll angioplasty","primaryPurpose":"DIAGNOSTIC","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":15,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"SFDI Imaging","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"SFDI Imaging performed on both ipsilateral and contralateral foot.

Despite continuous advancements in diagnostic and treatment technologies, patients of all age groups fail to meet the glycemic targets. Currently, there is a common deficiency in the management of T1D both domestically and internationally, which is specifically manifested as: the disconnection between blood glucose monitoring and insulin adjustment, low utilization rate of new technologies, insufficient patient self-management training, and the absence of psychological intervention, etc.\n\nThis GLITTER Study 2 extends the GLITTER Study (Glycemic Improvement with Team, Technology, Education and Peer Resources in type 1 diabetes) by implementing its philosophy (Team, Technology, Education, Peer Resources) to develop a comprehensive T1D management model, integrating these components to enhance management and evaluate effectiveness.\n\nThis multicentre, cluster-randomized controlled trial will be conducted across 10 hospitals. It aims to enroll patients with T1D aged ≥6 years who have had the disease for \\>3 months. Five hospitals were randomly assigned to the comprehensive management intervention group, and five to the usual care group. A total of 400 individuals were recruited into the study. The intervention for the intervention group includes: T1D team (dedicated T1D physicians, certified diabetes educators, registered dietitians), centralized structured education (courses, short videos, and structured educational materials), peer support (volunteer matching, camp, volunteer peer live streaming), and diabetes technologies (insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring). The control group received usual care, with the five assigned hospitals continuing their clinical practice. This 52-week trial includes assessments at the following timepoints: screening, week 13 (visit 2), week 26 (visit 3), week 39 (visit 4), and week 52 (visit 5). Throughout the study period, we will evaluate the model's impact on glycemic control and psychosocial outcomes, aiming to establish an evidence-based clinical practice paradigm for T1D management."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes"],"keywords":["Type 1 diabetes","Comprehensive management","T1D teams","Structured education","Peer resources","Diabetes technologies","Glycemic control"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"RANDOMIZED","interventionModel":"PARALLEL","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"SINGLE","whoMasked":["OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR"]}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":400,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"Intervention group","type":"EXPERIMENTAL","description":"Patients with T1D in the intervention group will undergo comprehensive management.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: T1D team, structured education, peer support , and diabetes technologies"]},{"label":"Control group","type":"OTHER","description":"Patients with T1D in the control group will receive routine management.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: Routine Management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"T1D team, structured education, peer support , and diabetes technologies","description":"Patients with T1D will use insulin pumps and CGM , while undergoing structured education courses under the management of a specialized T1D team and engaging in peer support activities.","armGroupLabels":["Intervention group"]},{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"Routine Management","description":"Patients with T1D will be managed according to the routine diagnosis and education model of each hospital.","armGroupLabels":["Control group"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in HbA1c","description":"The primary outcome is the Change in Glycated Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) before and after the 52 weeks intervention.

The aim of the GLITTER Study is to improve the metabolic control rate in patients with type 1 diabetes through a comprehensive management approach.","detailedDescription":"Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) face significant glycemic fluctuations, posing substantial challenges in disease management. Current clinical evidence indicates that although interventions such as structured education programs, peer support, and novel diabetes technologies demonstrate positive outcomes when applied individually, the glycemic target attainment rate remains suboptimal, with fewer than 30% achieving this benchmark. To address this clinical dilemma, the investigators has proposed the GLITTER (Glycemic Improvement with Team, Technology, Education and Peer Resources in type 1 diabetes) study, which aims to establish a four-in-one integrated management model combining multidisciplinary collaborative teams, structured educational frameworks, peer support systems, and diabetes technologies. The research team comprises T1D-specialized physicians and diabetes educators. Structured education is delivered through dedicated T1D specialty clinics and by local clinicians. Technological support involves informing patients about access to continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and insulin pumps without mandating their use, while peer support is established through patient communication groups (volunteer matching mechanisms are not yet implemented). This GLITTER study seeks to achieve dual objectives: population-wide coverage and whole-disease-course management for individuals with T1D.\n\nThis is a multicenter, prospective, cohort study. This longitudinal investigation systematically collects multidimensional clinical datasets encompassing glycemic control parameters, pancreatic β-cell function, and complication risk profiles through regular follow-up visits. This study explores the metabolic control, psychological outcomes, and their associated influencing factors among patients with T1D."},"conditionsModule":{"conditions":["Type 1 Diabetes (T1D)"],"keywords":["Type 1 diabetes","Comprehensive management"]},"designModule":{"studyType":"INTERVENTIONAL","phases":["NA"],"designInfo":{"allocation":"NA","interventionModel":"SINGLE_GROUP","primaryPurpose":"SUPPORTIVE_CARE","maskingInfo":{"masking":"NONE"}},"enrollmentInfo":{"count":3000,"type":"ESTIMATED"}},"armsInterventionsModule":{"armGroups":[{"label":"T1D Patients","type":"OTHER","description":"All patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes of all ages.","interventionNames":["Behavioral: GLITTER comprehensive management"]}],"interventions":[{"type":"BEHAVIORAL","name":"GLITTER comprehensive management","description":"The GLITTER comprehensive management represents a management approach that effectively combines multidisciplinary professional team care, diabetes technology empowerment, structured education steering, and peer support.","armGroupLabels":["T1D Patients"]}]},"outcomesModule":{"primaryOutcomes":[{"measure":"Change in HbA1c","description":"The primary outcome is the Change in Glycated Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c).
